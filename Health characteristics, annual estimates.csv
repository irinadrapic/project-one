2,"All estimates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories ('refusal', 'don't know', and 'not stated') in the denominator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Data for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) are collected yearly from a sample of approximately 65,000 respondents. The Canadian Health Indicators are tabulated by sex and age group in two main tables. The table 13-10-0096-01 presents the most up-to-date population health estimates for the ten provinces and is updated yearly. The table 13-10-0113-01 (to be released in autumn of 2017) presents estimates from two-year combined data and features breakdowns by all provinces and territories as well as by health regions. These estimates are less current than annual estimates, but have higher precision given the larger sample (less variability). Users should refer to the annual data table 13-10-0096-01 as the primary source for the most current estimates from the survey as well as to obtain data from previous years (where available). However, where data quality flags indicate suppression (F) or higher variability (E), the two-year data table 13-10-0113-01 should be used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"As a result of the 2015 redesign, CCHS has a new collection strategy, a new sample design, and has undergone major content revisions. With all these factors taken together, caution should be taken when comparing data from previous cycles to data released for the 2015 cycle onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 15.1% to 35.0% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 35.0% or that did not meet the minimum sample size requirement were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving their own health status as being either excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived health refers to the perception of a person's health in general, either by the person himself or herself, or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding. Health means not only the absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving their own mental health status as being excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived mental health refers to the perception of a person's mental health in general. Perceived mental health provides a general indication of the population suffering from some form of mental disorder, mental or emotional problems, or distress, not necessarily reflected in perceived health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving that most days in their life were quite a bit or extremely stressful. Perceived life stress refers to the amount of stress in the person's life, on most days, as perceived by the person or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Body mass index (BMI) is a method of classifying body weight according to health risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the respondent's body weight (in kilograms) by their height (in metres) squared.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated for the population aged 12 and over, excluding pregnant females and persons less than 3 feet (0.914 metres) tall or greater than 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 metres).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, the index for body weight classification for the population aged 18 and older is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight); 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III). The population aged 12 to 17 is classified as 'severely obese', 'obese', or 'overweight' according to age and sex specific cut-off points defined by the World Health Organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"A systematic review of the literature concluded that the use of self-reported data among adults underestimates weight and overestimates height, resulting in lower estimates of obesity than those obtained from measured data. Using data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) subsample, where both measured and self-reported height and weight were collected, BMI correction equations have been developed. This table presents obesity estimates adjusted using these equations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2015 CCHS - Nutrition, all collect height and weight data and derive obesity rates based on Body Mass Index (BMI). Users should take note of the data collection method, the target population and the classification system used by each survey in order to select the appropriate data set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Population aged 15 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having arthritis. Arthritis includes osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but excludes fibromyalgia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

25,The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual both collect data on the prevalence of COPD and high blood pressure.

26,Population aged 12 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having high blood pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,Population aged 12 and over who reported being a current smoker. Does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30,Daily smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Statistics Canada has two main surveys that produce national and provincial smoking rates. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), and the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS), which replaces the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) beginning in 2013. Users should be aware of a number of differences between CCHS and CTADS. CCHS collects information from respondents aged 12 and over, CTADS collects information from respondents aged 15 and over; the two surveys use different sampling frames; the annual sample for CTADS is 20,000 compared to 65,000 for CCHS; in CCHS, smoking questions are asked in the context of a wide range of health-related behaviours whereas in CTADS, all questions are related to the use of multiple products and substances with addictive properties. Although these factors can influence the estimates produced at a single point in time, the trends produced by the two surveys have been noted to be very consistent over time. Rather than comparing smoking rates produced from the two surveys, Statistics Canada advises users to choose a single source, based on their objectives, and to use that source consistently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
