In this project we work towards indentifying if geographical location is a determinant of health in Canada. To come to our conclusion we are investigating the different factors that drive the differences in the mortality rates accross the cities in Canada. We will put a primary focus on the differences in:
* Health Behaviours
* Health Care Access
* Socioeconomic Status
